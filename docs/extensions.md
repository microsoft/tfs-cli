# TFX extension commands

Package, publish, and manage Team Services and Team Foundation Server extensions. To learn more, see an [introduction to extensions](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/extend/overview?view=vsts).

## Get started

To learn more about TFX, its pre-reqs and how to install, see the [readme](../README.md)

## Package an extension

### Extension Create Usage

`tfx extension create`

### Extension Create Arguments

* `--root`: Root directory.
* `--manifest-js`: Manifest in the form of a standard Node.js CommonJS module with an exported function. If present then the manifests and manifest-globs arguments are ignored.
* `--env`: Environment variables passed to the manifestJs module.
* `--manifests`: List of individual manifest files (space separated).
* `--manifest-globs`: List of globs to find manifests (space separated).
* `--override`: JSON string which is merged into the manifests, overriding any values.
* `--overrides-file`: Path to a JSON file with overrides. This partial manifest will always take precedence over any values in the manifests.
* `--rev-version`: Rev the latest version number of the extension and save the result.
* `--bypass-validation`: Bypass local validation.
* `--publisher`: Use this as the publisher ID instead of what is specified in the manifest.
* `--extension-id`: Use this as the extension ID instead of what is specified in the manifest.
* `--output-path`: Path to write the VSIX.
* `--loc-root`: Root of localization hierarchy (see README for more info).

### Extension Create Examples

#### Package for a different publisher

```bash
tfx extension create --publisher mypublisher --manifest-js myextension.config.js --env mode=production
```

#### Increment (rev) the patch segment of the extension version

For example, assume the extension's version is currently `0.4.0`

```bash
tfx extension create --rev-version
```

The version included in the packaged .VSIX and in the source manifest file is now `0.4.1`.

#### Manifest JS file

Eventually you will find the need to disambiguate in your manifest contents between development and production builds. Use the `--manifest-js` option to supply a Node.JS CommonJS module and export a function. The function will be invoked with an environment property bag as a parameter, and must return the manifest JSON object.

Environment variables for the property bag are specified with the `--env` command line parameter. These are space separated key-value pairs, e.g. `--env mode=production rootpath="c:\program files" size=large`.

An example manifest JS file might look like the following:

```js
module.exports = (env) => {
  let [idPostfix, namePostfix] = (env.mode == "development") ? ["-dev", " [DEV]"] : ["", ""];

  let manifest = {
    manifestVersion: 1,
    id: `myextensionidentifier${idPostfix}`,
    name: `My Great Extension${namePostfix}`,
    ...
    contributions: [
      {
        id: "mywidgetidentifier",
        properties: {
          name: `Super Widget${namePostfix}`,
          ...
        },
        ...
      }
    ]
  }

  if (env.mode == 'development') {
    manifest.baseUri = "https://localhost:3000";
  }

  return manifest;
}
```

## Publish an extension

### Extension Publish Usage

```bash
tfx extension publish
```

### Extension Publish Arguments

In addition to all of the `extension create` options, the following options are available for `extension publish`:

* `--vsix`: Path to an existing VSIX (to publish or query for).
* `--share-with`: List of accounts (VSTS) with which to share the extension.
* `--nowait-validation`: Use this paramater if you or the pipeline donâ€™t want to wait for the CLI tool to complete. The extension is published and available in the Marketplace only after completion successful validation.

### Extension Publish Example

```bash
tfx extension publish --publisher mypublisher --manifest-js myextension.config.js --env mode=development --share-with myaccount
```

### Tips

1. By default, `publish` first packages the extension using the same mechanism as `tfx extension create`. All options available for `create` are available for `publish`.
2. If an Extension with the same ID already exists publisher, the command will attempt to update the extension.
3. When you run the `publish` command, you will be prompted for a Personal Access Token to authenticate to the Marketplace. For more information about obtaining a Personal Access Token, see [Publish from the command line](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/devops/extend/publish/command-line?view=vsts).

## Other commands

* `tfx extension install`: Install a Visual Studio Services Extension to a list of VSTS Accounts.
* `tfx extension show`: Show information about a published extension.
* `tfx extension share`: Share an extension with an account.
* `tfx extension unshare`: Unshare an extension with an account.
* `tfx extension isvalid`: Checks if an extension is valid.

For more details on a specific command, run:

```bash
tfx extension {command} --help
```
